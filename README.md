# Company System MVC

This is a simple ASP.NET MVC web application built during my learning path in ASP.NET MVC development. The app demonstrates fundamental concepts such as user authentication, role-based access control, and token generation using ASP.NET Identity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Different roles (e.g., Admin, User) with varying access levels.
- **Token Generation**: JWT tokens are used for secure API communication.
- **Identity Framework**: Built-in ASP.NET Identity system for managing users and roles.

## üíª Technologies Used

- ASP.NET MVC / ASP.NET Core MVC *(Specify if you used Core or not)*
- C#
- Entity Framework / SQL Server *(or SQLite, if applicable)*
- ASP.NET Identity
- JWT Authentication

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project follows a basic MVC architecture:
- **Models**: Represent data and business logic.
- **Views**: Razor pages for UI rendering.
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and manage interactions between Models and Views.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EslamAbdelwahid/company-system-mvc.git
